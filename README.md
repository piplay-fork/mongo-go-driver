Go Driver Design Documentation
=
The purpose of this branch is to hold the design documentation for the Go driver.
This documentation is in a separate branch to allow it to easily be tracked independently
of the Go driver's code and to remove the noise of extra commits that will be unrelated
to the Go driver code.

The designs in this branch are for the driver API, the core API, the BSON library, or a combination
of all of the these.
